    """
    Test the `obtain_all_link_info` method of the `WebDataHunter` class.

    This test function mocks the `requests.get` method to simulate a successful HTTP request.
    It then calls the `obtain_all_link_info` method with a sample URL and a list of search terms.
    The method returns a dictionary containing the extracted information from the web page.

    The test asserts that the returned dictionary contains the expected values for the "Link", "Location",
    and "Price" keys. It also tests the interaction with the `GoogleSheetsClient` by asserting that the
    `update_links_info` method is called with the correct argument.

    Parameters:
        mock_get (MagicMock): A mock object of the `requests.get` method.
        web_hunter (WebDataHunter): An instance of the `WebDataHunter` class.
        mock_sheets_client (MagicMock): A mock object of the `GoogleSheetsClient` class.
